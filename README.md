**CNN Coverage: Tariffs vs Signalgate**  
![cnn_tariffs_signal.png](outputs/plots/cnn_tariffs_signal.png)  
I'm interested in easy ways to track how long a news cycle lasts, and whether one competes with another. Google Trends for news will show a similar pattern, but I understand that's just for user searches rather than news coverage. Here, the counts for each topic are just based on the headline summaries for CNN transcipt data, rather than the full transcripts. Would love to learn about similar sites for other news orgs.

**Average Gas vs Crude Oil Prices**  
Although the correlation is strong, the coloring here shows us that in later years the ratio of gas prices to oil prices is higher. This may also be due to some quality differences.

**Number of Strikes and Lockouts in OECD Countries**  
I've always been struck by the decline since the 1970s of strikes across so many countries around the same time.
